## How to contribute to the AIRR Common Repository Working Group (CRWG)
The CRWG is the home of the [AIRR Data Commons (ADC)](https://www.antibodysociety.org/the-airr-community/airr-data-commons/) and is repsonsible for
the development and the documentation of the [AIRR Data Commons API (ADC API)](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/api/adc_api.html). There are
many ways that you can contribute to the AIRR Community and AIRR CRWG.

#### **Join the working group** ####

The AIRR CRWG is an open, community based group, and all members are welcome. If you are interested in 
joining the working group and attending
the working group meetings, please send an email to common-repository@airr-community.org. The CRWG meets once a month, to discuss agenda items
that are oriented to meeting the [working groups goal for the current working session](https://www.antibodysociety.org/the-airr-community/airr-working-groups/repository/).

#### **Contribute your data** ####

The AIRR Data Commons would not exist without the [contributions of data to the repositories in the ADC](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/standards/data_submission.html). 
The AIRR Community encourages reseachers to share their AIRR-seq data as broadly as possible. If you are interested in running your own AIRR compliant repository, you can download
and install the [iReceptor Turnkey software](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php/blob/production-v4/README.md). If you want to upload your own data, you can
utilize the [VDJServer Community Portal](https://vdj-staging.tacc.utexas.edu/community/).

#### **Participate through GitHub** ####

The CRWG either uses [Github Issues from this repository](https://github.com/airr-community/common-repo-wg/issues),
the [ADC Registry Github repository](https://github.com/airr-community/adc-registry),
or for more standards based issues the [AIRR Standards Github repository](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/issues).

In order to find issues related to CRWG and the ADC in the AIRR Standards Github repository search for either an ADC label or milestone as linked below:

* [ADC API label](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/labels/ADC%20API%20V2)
* [ADC API milestone](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/milestone/9)

##### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

##### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

##### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the iReceptor platform will generally not be accepted.


#### **Please join us!**

The AIRR Community is only as strong as those that contribute, and we rely on such contributions. We encourage you to pitch in and add your input to help continue
to develop a strong AIRR Community!
